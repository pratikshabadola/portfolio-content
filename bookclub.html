	<p>Every month, I host a book club over Zoom with a group of other folks who have read my book of the month! This book club is a safe space for all regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical ability, or immigration status. We're just a community that really loves to read and excitedly chatter about what we read! If that interests you, please fill in the intake form below so you can receive a Zoom link to next month's book club!</p>
